Does the Google Pixel 4a work on Sprint? Sprint Rep says no

I was just about to purchase a Pixel 4a and I called my local Sprint/T-Mobile store just to double check and make sure they could activate it and it would work. The sales rep told me Sprint was having trouble with the Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a 5G. He said he's seen all sorts of issues from unable to activate to unable to make calls, texts etc. He said most of the Pixel 4a and 4a 5G phones he's activated have been defective in some way. He was really trying to dissuade me from getting a Pixel phone. The rep said that this is a well known issue - but I did a few searches and I didn't really find a well known issue with the Pixel 4a being unable to work with Sprint. Can anyone confirm this?
