Google Store Financing

Hi Everyone!  I am a bit panicked right now.  I bought my first pixel phone (the 3) about two years ago and needed to get a new phone.  I wanted to get the Google Pixel 5 and decided to sign up for the monthly payment plan.  Well, turns out it is a credit card or something and to be honest it sounds fucking scary.

If anyone has used this financing before how does it work?  I am really worried about having another credit card (I'm fine on credit and money, but credit cards still scare me).  How will this affect my credit?  I know that since they checked my credit score it will go down a little bit, but how else will it affect my credit?  I know it is a credit card and I'm only going to be using it once.  I'm just confused and need someone to explain it to me before I start to panic (which is probably too late).
