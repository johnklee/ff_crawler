Pixel 5 not showing as an ADB Device

Friend of mine tried to flash an image to his pixel 5 without experience. The pixel is now stuck in Fastboot mode but at least unlocked and ready for a flash. I have attempted to flash all ADB Devices connected via USB but the command is not picking up any devices.
Any Ideas
