Pixel dropped to the floor and won't start up

My pixel dropped to the floor today, the screen was on when I picked it up then immediately went off. When I attempted to turn it back on, it showed the battery icon with red base (like in low battery) for half a second then went off. My battery was on 40%+ before the fall.

Charging: When I plugged it in, it does not show any charging indicator. I left it plugged in for more than 10mins (direct then pc), and it still does not charge. One thing I noticed that the google icon comes up for a second if I press the power button when the phone is plugged in, but then it goes off immediately.

When I attempted recovery mode when plugged in, it started entering the mode but went off as soon as I take my hands off the buttons.

I am in a pixel unsupported country with no iFixit. If you have any possible solution, it is welcome please.
