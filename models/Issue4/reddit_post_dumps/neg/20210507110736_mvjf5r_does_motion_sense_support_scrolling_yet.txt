Does Motion Sense support scrolling yet?

I get mild tendinitis from holding my phone and scrolling so much, so scrolling with gestures seemed like the "killer feature" when I heard about Motion Sense. But everything I've read about the available Motion Sense gestures makes it sound completely underutilized, especially if I can't scroll.

Is scrolling with Motion Sense supported yet in the Pixel 4?
