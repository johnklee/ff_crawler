Now that the pixel 5 has been out for a while..

What cases and in car holders are you guys using? I have a Spigen case. Been considering a Mous case and possibly the holder too. But it's a little bit more than I'd want it to be lol. 

I have a Spigen magnetic holder from my previous phone, in my car still.. but annoyingly the Pixel 5 won't stick to it (because of the wireless charger on the back, something I've never used yet.)

What's out there now?
