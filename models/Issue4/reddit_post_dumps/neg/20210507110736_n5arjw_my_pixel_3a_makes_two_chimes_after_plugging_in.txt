My Pixel 3a makes two chimes after plugging in. They are about 5 seconds apart. Does anyone else know why or have the same issue?

I recently cleaned the USB C port but I can't recall if that is when it started or if it was doing it before. I am pretty sure it did it before and that is what made me think to clean the port.

Some added comments and notes below but in total I can't find a connection issue. I'm going to need to try another USB C charger to see if it is my charger.  Try isolate the issue.
