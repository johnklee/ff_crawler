Smart Lock issues

My Smart Lock (Pixel 5) began malfunctioning a few weeks back, where it no longer stays unlocked at my house, even though I've confirmed the location a couple different times.

I've tried turning the location off and on, moving my home pin and moving it back, restarting my phone, etc. without any success.

Does anyone have any other ideas on how to get this to reengage? Definitely a first world problem and doesn't make me enjoy my Pixel any less, but it's annoying that it is showing as enabled but not working as expected.
