Just got the find of a lifetime today. Basically brand new pixel 5 for $113.

So I'm a phone reseller. Recently had some great finds buying with the same company. I got a brand new Galaxy Note 9 for $129, brand new S10+ for $117, and a slightly used but mint condition pixel 5 for only $113.

I have NO idea why someone would put such a phone for such a low price. But all I care about is that it's in my hands and perfectly functional, not locked or blacklisted.

Edit: A lot of people are suggesting it was not paid off. Verizon was the original carrier, I just called them and they confirmed it was paid off. Please, stop suggesting I'm trying to scam people. I'm not.
