opening "app info" from the recent apps page hangs for arouns 4 5 seconds before showing

this suddenly started to happen today, i have tried to force reboot, restart in safe mode, clear settings data and cache but still whenever i open app info of any app, it hangs for few seconds.
anyone else had this issue before?
