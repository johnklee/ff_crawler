Pixel 2 Slot Unbootable: Load Error

Hi all,

My girlfriend has a Pixel 2 that just went nuts this morning. It shows the bootloader screen with the Android logo with its front open. 

I'm seeing an "ERROR: Slot Unbootable: Load Error" when I try to start it, and am unable to successfully select any of the other options. If I try download mode, it says "ERROR: Operation Denied" & if I try recovery mode, it says "ERROR: BootLinux Failed: Not started".

Connecting to my windows pc, I'm able to see it as a listed device in fastboot but not adb, I do not believe developer options or USB debugging was enabled before it went bust.

Any advice here? Hoping to salvage at least the data on the phone but would be amazing if we could get the phone up and running fully.
