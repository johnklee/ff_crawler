"Hot" take: 5g, at least on the pixel 5, makes for a worse ux

Why would I write such a blasphemous title?

Well, 5g uses a ton of battery on my pixel 5, and makes the device run hot as hell. I was using it in the car - someone else was driving - and halfway through I went into my settings and changed my preferred network to lte instead.

The device almost instantly cooled down, my battery graph leveled out a little bit, and nothing was loading any slower.

I think I'll be keeping it at lte, and slightly regretting the 700+ I spent to basically only get more storage, memory, and battery, but worse speakers and aspect ratio (2:1 is still the superior aspect imo) over my pixel 3.

Any 5g pixel users feel the same way?
