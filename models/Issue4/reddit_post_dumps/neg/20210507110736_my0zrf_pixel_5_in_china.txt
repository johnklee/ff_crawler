Pixel 5 in China

I'm currently in Shanghai and just got a China Unicom SIM card from my employer yesterday. The service seems to work pretty well, but there are a few issues. I can't seem to get the China Unicom app that everyone else has, is it possible for it to be blocked in the Play Store just for Pixel? I've actually run into this with a couple other apps as well, people at work will tell me there's an English language version of an app and I won't be able to find it. Has anyone had experience with this or know what could cause it?
