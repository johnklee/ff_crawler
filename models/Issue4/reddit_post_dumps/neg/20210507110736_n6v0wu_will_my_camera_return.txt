Will my camera return?

It sometimes does, sometimes doesn't 

P2XL a bit old but had been absolutely beautiful until recently this April... 


... I feel like I lost a good portion of my life now that I can't take pictures with my phone (sans selfies) 

Help. Google support said to factory reset but like hell I'll do that and reviews complaining of the same thing says factory reset hasn't helped them either

E: welp, consensus is it won't return ;( guess I'll get a new phone rip
