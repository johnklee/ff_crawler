I have yet another question about switching over from iOS

Ok so, I recently jumped over to pixel from iOS. Before in my car (2013 Ford focus) I'd plug my phone into the USB port, press my voice control button on my car and say "USB" anf it would start playing audio from my phone (Spotify) through my car speakers.

When I try the same thing with my pixel, it says no media found. What am I doing wrong?
