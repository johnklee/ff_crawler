My Pixel RMA experience: Google, it's getting tiresome.

My Pixel 5's vibration motor had been acting up ever since I bought it 5 months ago, but I was quite reluctant to reach out to Google about it after all the bad RMA experiences I had read about. Now I **am** one of those experiences.

Well, the issue was beginning to worsen evermore so I had no choice but to suck it in, dismiss all the things I had read about merely as bad luck, and finally decide to request a replacement on **20/04/21**.

Within 10 mins of talking to a support agent, I had an RMA confirmation email and DHL Express shipping label in my hands ready to send in my defective device. DHL tracking can confirm that it was received by Google on **22/04/21,** two days later.

Eagerly awaiting my new phone, I checked on it a few days later with support and was told that it would take 24-48 hrs for inspection, then the replacement would be dispatched and I would receive an email with tracking info. I was reassured that everything was going smoothly.

Well, a week later of total silence, and I decided to check on it yet again as it had been a lot longer than the 24-48 hrs stated. This time I was told 'I have consulted your case to our Higher Support team and we are working on it', and from now on for the past 10 days all I have been told by support is that they are 'awaiting a response from Higher Support'.

I don't know what the hell is going on or who 'Higher Support' really is, but all I know is that I need my goddamn phone.

As of now, **07/05/21**, it has been almost three weeks since Google received my device and I have been told nothing but to 'wait patiently for a response'. Waiting patiently is all I have been doing and it clearly isn't getting me anywhere.

If there's an issue occurring with my RMA, couldn't they at least do a better job of informing me about what's happening with it and being a little more proactive, instead of leaving me in the dust like this?

I feel unvalued and disregarded by the level of support I am receiving, and the fact of the matter is that there are many others out there who have had to deal with this as well. Take [u/toasterstudel2's experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jmpdf8/google_pixel_rma_support_is_the_worst_experience/) for example, which is almost identical to mine.

It doesn't seem to be dependant on geographical location either. It's happening with me in the UK, in Canada, in Brazil, in the US, etc. and it's utterly ridiculous.

Google, for one of the biggest companies in the world, there are much higher expectations from a company such as you, and you are more than capable of delivering. I am straight up disappointed with my experience and I'm clearly not alone.

Google, it's getting tiresome.

**Thanks for reading, and sorry for the excessive amount of text. I will be sure to leave the current status of my situation down below, and would really appreciate it if I could get some advice on what to do. For now, I am basically stuck with awaiting a response that will never arrive as far as I'm concerned.**

TL;DR: It has been almost 3 weeks and Google still hasn't shipped my replacement device and are being very unhelpful about it. They should be doing a much better job given the company they are. I live in the UK.
