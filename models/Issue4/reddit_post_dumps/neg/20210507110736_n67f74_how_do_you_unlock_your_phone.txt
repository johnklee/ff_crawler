How do you unlock your phone?

Hey Team. How do you unlock your pixel phone? I'm planning of switching from OnePlus 7T to Pixel 5 , but two things that I do not like about is that it doesn't have face unlock and that fingerprint scanner is on the back. I'm very often having my phone on the keyboard and unlocking it either with face or built in fingerprint scanner. Thanks.
