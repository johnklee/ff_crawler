How do I move saved app passwords from Pixel 3A to Pixel 4A

I just got a Pixel 4A.  How do I get my saved application passwords over to this phone?  I've got all my apps on it but its going to be a nightmare to have to sign into each app and remember my password/reset it etc.  Can't I just sync it somehow?
