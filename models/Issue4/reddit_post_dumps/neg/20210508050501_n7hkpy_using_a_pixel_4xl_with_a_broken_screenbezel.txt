Using a Pixel 4XL with a broken screen/bezel

TL;DR phone screen broke, still works to my surprised, will keep until I find a more interesting phone to get. 



I just wanted to share my experience with how it is to use a Pixel 4XL that's screen got cracked thanks to my puppy chewing on it (he's okay thankfully) (also it had a case a screen protector, that didn't not cover the whole top bezel, so yeah that was a waste of money) 

To begin with, the front camera is toast in the sense that since the top bezel has the most damage, the front camera will show cracks on the view finder but it's still workable 

Motion sense still works, well works in the best way it was able to since Google has given up on adding or fixing anything on the Pixel 4 soli sensor.  But surprised that it works still. 

Screen has two hair line scratched that run across it. Barely noticeable but I feel like sometimes the touch does not register as well as it used to. 

Overall though I'm surprised I have no other major issues and I'm gonna keep it. Well keep it until the new Asus and Xperia drop or perhaps wait on the Pixel 6. Maybe I'll switch back to ios after 6 years. We'll see.
