thought before switching from iPhoneX to Pixel5

i have been a long term iOS user (from iphone4, 5, 6, 7, X).

I have had experience with androids before too, HTC legend, Google Nexus, Sony Z1.

Reason that i hesitated since Pixel 5 release is that i was bounded to Apple environment, from car play to air play and even apple pay. 

i mainly plan to get the pixel 5 for photos actually, i take lots of photos of my kids and i heard amazing reviews on Pixel5 camera.
hope im not spending the money to regret, my wife also questioned why i wanted to switch out of apple. i don’t know the answer to that exactly, it’s probly Google, not android. cause i never consider to buy Mi, Huawei, etc.
