Easy way to transfer Samsung Notes data to Pixel? (Galaxy S8 to Pixel 4a 5G)

Moving from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to a Pixel 4a 5G and I haven't found any easy way to transfer my Samsung Notes data to a Pixel. When I moved from iOS back to Android four years ago I was able to easily backup all of my notes into Google drive with a few clicks but every process I've seen for Samsung Notes requires, at the very least, clicking every note and at the worst it's a bunch of file conversion. Lots of googling and subreddit searching haven't turned up much new info. 

If there are any new, updated ways to easily backup/transfer my Samsung Notes to a Pixel I'd love to hear it. Also probably going to use Google Keep on my new phone for note taking but any other good/free note app recommendations would be appreciated. 

Also most of my notes in Samsung Notes are text, don't care if the images or drawings don't convert over, just want another notes app with a search function that can be used offline and has a way to back up the notes. 

Finally leaving Samsung after they started putting ads in their stock apps, like Notes, and forced updates that make them run like ass. I bought a flagship phone why the hell are there ads on the stock weather widget? I have an unlocked phone (because US telecom companies are a shithole cartel) so I got their already-late updates after ALL of the other Samsung phone models get it. Plus those couple'a months where my GPS just didn't really work and Samsung didn't really feel as though it was an urgent issue. Happy to finally try out a Pixel!
