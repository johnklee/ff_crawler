Smartwatch with vibrating alarm

Morning all. I'm considering a smartwatch of some sort, but having recently moved from iphone to Pixel, I'm not sure what the options are. One big thing I'd like is a vibrating alarm. I used to have a basic fitbit that did that, and I loved the feature as I typically have three alarms set every 10 minutes and don't get up until the last alarm. It bothers my husband because it also wakes him up every 10 minutes. With the Fitbit it would vibrate and hence not bother him. 

I considered another basic fitbit but I like the other features a smartwatch has, ie texting/calling, reminders, etc. 

Any recommendations? This will likely be a birthday gift from either mt parents or in laws so I don't want it to be crazy expensive. Thanks!
