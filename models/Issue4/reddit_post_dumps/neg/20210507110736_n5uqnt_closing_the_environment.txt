Closing the environment

Starting with Android 10, apps that lists the opened connections no longer work.

Wifi scanning require location permission.

GPS-only for positioning requires that data be turned off.

What will Android 15 be like?

Google is closing the environment around data gathering, it seems. Everything else gets slowly removed.
