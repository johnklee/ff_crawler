Screen goes black and won't turn on

So I have a 4xl and at times the screen goes black and won't turn back on the phone still works. But I can't see anything on the screen. It can last from anywhere from 5 minutes till 7 hours before it turns back on. Any advice on how to fix it. The screen is not cracked and the phone has never had any major drops always been in a case since I got it and no water damage.
