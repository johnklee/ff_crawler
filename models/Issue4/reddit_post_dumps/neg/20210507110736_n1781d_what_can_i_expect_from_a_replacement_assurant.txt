What can I expect from a replacement Assurant Pixel 4 XL?

A bit of background first:

I have a Google Pixel 4 XL 128 GB that I purchased on launch day. Everything works perfectly *except* the wireless charging, which stopped working out of nowhere about three months ago. I've tried three totally different wireless chargers, reflashing, and factory resetting the phone all to no avail. Due to the lack of others reporting similar issues recently, I've concluded it must be a hardware issue.

Now, my question:

Considering that I've kept the phone in pristine condition, can I expect the same from the Assurant replacement, or are there risks (minor cosmetic damage?, reduced battery life?, future reliability issues?) that outweigh the inconvenience of no wireless charging? I'm particularly interested in hearing from those who have had their replacement phone for 6+ months.
