Touch screen issues on Pixel 4A (non 5g)

My gfs pixel 4A is having touch screen issues where it is unresponsive to most taps and will sometimes just click random spots or scroll on its own. It kind of seemed like there was something on the screen at first, but then it became apparent that the device was just not working properly. 

I know there were reports early this year that Android 11 messed up a lot of people’s screens, but I don’t see any recent news or articles about fixes for this. She just got the phone a couple of weeks ago, hasn’t dropped it or gotten it wet. She’s not sure what software version it’s on and it won’t even let us get close to the settings to see what it is. 

Is there a fix? Will google replace it? Or Amazon (where we bought it)?
