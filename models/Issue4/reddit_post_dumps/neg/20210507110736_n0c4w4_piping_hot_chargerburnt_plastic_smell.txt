Piping hot charger/Burnt plastic smell

Got in my car this morning and plugged my phone in to keep it charged up until I got to work. Happened to look down at it while driving and I saw a red UPDATE CHARGER notification and saw it said something about removing the cable, so I quickly did and the notification disappeared before I could read the rest. The tip of the charger was piping hot and now it won't work and my phone's charging port smells like burnt plastic.

I'm going to see if the actual Google Charger at home works before taking any action. If it doesn't and my phone is indeed toast. 

I'm at work so I can't check until later, but my only hope is that when I blew into the charging port the Liquid or Debris in USB port detected message came up so that tells me it's ag least responsive..

Anyone with similar experiences?
