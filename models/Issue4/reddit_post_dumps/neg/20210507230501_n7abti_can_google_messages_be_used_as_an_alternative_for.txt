CAN GOOGLE MESSAGES BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR WHATSAPP?

I don't know why but it feels like WhatsApp just isn't working for me anymore. While I do use Telegram a lot of my friends and colleagues don't. 

So here's what I wanted to ask, is google messages just a SMS app or can it be used like a messaging platform such as whatsapp? what I mean here is that if I'm connected to the internet then is sending messages free of charge or does it cost me? Also, will all of my messages be sent as SMS's or as normal messages? 

I do have a Pixel phone but I haven't used google messages much so I would appreciate it if you guys could help me out here.
