Pixel 4A inquiries

Hello,  
So I have just bought the pixel 4a unboxed and set up just a few questions I have

When opening apps/games they tend to not fill the whole screen and only fill it to where the punch hole is how do i make it fill to the very top.

When I turn off the phone the phone doesnt completely turn off it just goes dark with the time how do i fix this in settings so when i turn it off it turns off instead of half off.

How do you guys feel about the clicky buttons for me I really don't like them maybe I will after continuous use but for now I hate them.

Any glass screen protectors to recommend?

Thanks in advance
