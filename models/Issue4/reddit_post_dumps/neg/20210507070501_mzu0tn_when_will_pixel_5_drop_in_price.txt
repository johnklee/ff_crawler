When will Pixel 5 drop in price?

I haven't seen Pixel 5 having any stellar sales since its release. With talk of the next phones coming out do you guys have any idea when google might drop prices on the Pixel 5? Ive been considering buying a second hand or refurbished Pixel 5 on ebay, but am worried about warranty transfer issues and wonder if I should just spend the extra to buy new. With my luck though, Google will drop prices right after I make the purchase. Thanks for your thoughts on this.
