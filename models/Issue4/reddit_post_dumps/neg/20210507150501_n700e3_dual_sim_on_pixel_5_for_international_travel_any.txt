Dual sim on pixel 5 for international travel? Any issues with Verizon + Google Fi

I have a verizon pixel 5, and would like to have an option for overseas use that doesn't involve buying new sims at each country, or paying $10/day to Verizon.  I am thinking of using google fi when I travel, and verizon when I'm in the USA.  So I would activate/deactivate google fi as needed.  Verizon said I can't have google fi on the esim, I can only have it on the physical sim, so I would have to remove the Verizon sim( I didn't have confidence that Verizon tech support understood the issue). Are there any issues I need to be aware of?
