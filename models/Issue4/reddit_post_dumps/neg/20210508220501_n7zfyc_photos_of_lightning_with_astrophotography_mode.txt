Photos of lightning with astrophotography mode

Pixel 4xl astrophotography mode is insane.

I was taking photos of a thunderstorm and I wouldn't even dream to be able to take photos like these.

I pretty much just started astrophotography mode and waited for lightning, then stopped it once it appears on the photo preview.
