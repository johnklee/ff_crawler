Pixel 3a- Notifications disappear randomly

I just got a text that showed up on my screen for less than one second, then the screen shut off and it was gone. not under silent or anything like that. I had to go into my messaging app to see it. Other texts do not do this. I've had this issue with snapchat and whatsapp messages too? can anyone help me fix this major issue?
