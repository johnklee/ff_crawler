Pixel 4 XL > Galaxy Fold 2

Mind you, I have always given my phones a workout, use a lot of apps and multitask heavily, but...

The Android phones I have owned, listed from oldest to most recent:

1. Motorola Droid
2. Nexus 4
3. LG G3
4. Nexus 6P
5. Galaxy Note 8
6. Galaxy Fold
7. Galaxy Fold 2
8. Pixel 3 XL
9. Pixel 4 XL

The Android phones I have owned, listed from smoothest operating to the most laggy...

1. Pixel 4 XL (butter, ZERO hiccups or lagging)
2. Pixel 3 XL (pretty much the same as the 4 XL)
3. Nexus 6P (was very rarely not perfect)
4. Nexus 4 (same as 6P)
5. LG G3 (was very smooth 95% of the time)
6. Galaxy Note 8 (was smooth 90% of the time, occasionally had hiccups and lagging, but had various issues)
7. Motorola Droid (smooth for the time, but this was still a very early version of Android)
8. Galaxy Fold (fast when it was fast, but lagging and hiccups were rather frequent)
9. Galaxy Fold 2 (riddled with lagging and hiccups, would occasionally lock up)

As I said, I am demanding on a phone, but I bought the Pixel 3 XL used and kept it as my daily driver for a couple months to see if it ran better than the Fold 2, and it ran circles around it! I am now fully converted to Pixel!!!
