Need help with charging port replacement in Australia

Hi everyone!
Just thought I'd ask here as a bit of a last resort and see if anyone had any insight.
I recently bought a Pixel 5 and promptly broke pins from the charging port trying to clean it out (definitely learned a lesson there). My issue now is that not a single repair place will touch it, either through fear of breaking the screen or because the port is soldered to the boards. I've communicated with Google's recommended repair centre and they want to charge a $140 'evaluation fee' which considering every other places reaction I'm not keen to pay. 

Is there anything I can do? Does anyone have recommendations for places that will actually repair the phone? 

I'm about ready to sell the phone off, lose a whole bunch of money and go back to the $300 Motorola that was apparently built tougher and easier to repair. Would be a shame.
