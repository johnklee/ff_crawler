Pixel 3 (Android 11) just started bootlooping... is this common?

this is bringing back my Nexus 5x nightmare...  

Out of the blue, my Pixel 3 just started bootlooping.  I finally was able to boot it up and shut it down, but it took a while.

Is this common?

If I get it back up, should I just run a factory reset?
