Wifi won't connect anymore and I don't understand why ðŸ˜©

Not sure if this is a common issue but my wifi is usually always on and currently won't connect. Have reset my wifi on both the router & the phone itself. I get a seriously bad signal in my house so I rely heavily on the wifi. If anyone has any ideas let me know.
