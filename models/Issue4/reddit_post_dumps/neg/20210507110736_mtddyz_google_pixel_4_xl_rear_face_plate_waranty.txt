Google Pixel 4 XL - Rear Face Plate + Waranty

Hello Reddit!

I am hoping that some can shine some light on what options that I might have at this point. About six months ago, the rear plate on my Pixel 4 XL started lifting off; the adhesive was wearing down / off, I guess. This is a pretty well documented issue on Reddit + internet of this happening.

Anyway, I was able to get a warranty replacement on that issue no problem; got a new device. Well, my current handset I have only had for barely six months, and it is already happening AGAIN to me.

Now when I chat in with Google Fi (where I have my device through) - they are now refusing to warranty this saying that the device warranty has expired - despite not even having this handset for a full year.

Is this normal; or are they breaching contract? They are willing to replace my handset; but only under the extended warranty with a $100 deductible. Since this is a manufacturer defect; why are they saying its no longer covered?

This doesn't seem right / or they KNOW that this is a problem and they are avoidng replacing any additional devices.

They initially were arguing damage on the device; and then I sent them photographs front and back to prove no damage. They started to complete the process; but then back tracked.
