4a 5g YouTube premium

Hey guys,  I was going to sign up for the free 3 months YouTube premium deal that came with my 4a 5g but when I tap the link in the email it takes me to the standard one month free sign up page.  Just wondering if I sign up from that page will I get the 3 months or just one?  Rules say I have until April 30.
