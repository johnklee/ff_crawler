Wireless Charging Stops at 65% to 68% - Pixel 5 May '21 Update

Applied the May 2021 update 2 days ago. Left my Pixel 5 on the Pixel Stand overnight to charge.

Woke up this morning to find it overheating and stopped at 68%. Thought I misplaced it or I moved it a little bit through the night so stopped charging. I placed it back on the stand. I come back an hour later, still stuck at 65%.

Restarted the phone, removed it from its case and placed it on the stand again. 30 mins later, no improvement. Charging via cable with no issue.

Any similar cases or explanation?
