Google Pixel 4 selfie camera has been horrible these last couple of months.

Hello everyone. When I upgraded from the Google Pixel 1 XL to the Google Pixel 4 XL, I was excited. Outside of the obvious upgrades, I was more so excited to try the new cameras. However, the selfie camera for me (especially on Snapchat) has been nothing short of awful in anything other than pristine lighting. 

I understand there isn't autofocus for the selfie camera anymore. I cleaned up a fingerprint smudge on the camera and saw moderate improvement. However, it's still lackluster and I'm honestly considering moving to a new brand of phone as photography is huge to me. 

Any thoughts or insights?
