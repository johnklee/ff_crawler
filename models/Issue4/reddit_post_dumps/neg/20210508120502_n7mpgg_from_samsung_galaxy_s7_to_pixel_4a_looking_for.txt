From Samsung Galaxy S7 to Pixel 4a! Looking for tips to settle in

I'm glad the 4a exists! There are so few phones in this size (no more than 145 x 70 mm) that also have OIS. The headphone jack is the cherry on top.

I love the 4a so far. That said, I have a few questions:

* Can I change the lockscreen clock?
* Is the Always on Display customizable? Furthermore, can I view the AOD with 1 tap and wake the phone with 2 taps? Lastly... This is an extremely long shot but I still miss features from Nokia's pre-Android days. That includes [custom backgrounds of any size](https://i.imgur.com/Pm5LlAQ.jpg) (not lighting every pixel saves battery, hence the slight graininess), setting \*multiple\* rotating backgrounds, widgets, and the ability to control AOD duration (e.g. 30 seconds). Does such an app exist?
* The quick settings panel. The Galaxy S7 (on Android 8) had 12 items. The Pixel 4a has 6. Can I increase this?
* Google's camera app is wonderful, and I'll use it a lot. There are still occasions when I want manual controls. Like fast movement, light trails, motion blur on purpose, or reducing noise at the cost of holding very still. Any suggestions for a 3rd party app?
* What's the best app for scrolling screenshots?
