The Pixel Stand might be the worst waste of money I've ever spent on a tech product.

I've used tons of Google products and I've had some issues with them just like everyone else has, but I don't think I've ever actually regretted buying one since the LTE Galaxy Nexus... until the Pixel Stand. The charging speed is consistently atrocious, and the Pixel-specific features are questionable useful at best. I got this thing for half off and I still feel ripped off.

I average around 450 mA charging speed regardless of the charging brick, charging cable, or outlet that I use, and regardless of whether or not there's a case on the phone. Un/re-pairing the Stand from my phone occasionally helps a little for a brief period of time, but the charging time always tanks quickly.
