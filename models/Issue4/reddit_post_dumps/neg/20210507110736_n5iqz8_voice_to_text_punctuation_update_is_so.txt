Voice to text punctuation update is so frustrating. Can I revert back on Pixel?

Until 2 days ago, when I spoke any voice to text messages {comma} it would put the actual "," instead of spelling out what the punctuation is {period}. Is there any way to fix this {question-mark} This is ridiculous {exclamation-point}

I only have English installed on my phone {period} This is happening across all apps {period}
