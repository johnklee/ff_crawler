After four years of solid service, I broke my Pixel 2XL screen. What do I do?

I put a spanner in my plan of waiting for the Pixel 6 this morning when I accidentally cracked the glass in my screen. Absolutely gutted because this phone has served me well and other than some slowdowns here and there (and a massive crack on the right side) is working perfectly fine. 

What should I do? Continue to hold out for the P6 or 5a, or jump ship to the P5?
