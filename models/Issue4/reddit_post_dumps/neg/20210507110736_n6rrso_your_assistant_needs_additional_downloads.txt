"Your Assistant Needs Additional Downloads"

I have a Google Pixel 4 and have had it for about a year now. I absolutely love the phone but I cant use the assistant. Every-time I call on the assistant I get the message, "Your assistant needs additional downloads" and when I go to download it always fails. This has been going on for months and I can't use the assistant unless I have the usb-c buds connected. Anyone have the same issue or know of any fix?
