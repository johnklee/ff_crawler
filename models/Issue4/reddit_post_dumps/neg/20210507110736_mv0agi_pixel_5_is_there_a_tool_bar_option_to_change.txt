[Pixel 5] Is there a tool bar option to change phones volume/vibrate/Silent?

When driving I sometimes forget to put my phone on mute and my WhatsApps / Messenger messages come through and it bugs the hell out of me. 

The issue I have is that my phone volume controls are covered by the car dock / cradle. This means that I usually have to unscrew it, click volume on the side and then click the bell and put it back in - this is hard to do when you're on a motorway and something I dont want to do. 

I would love it if I could just swipe down from the top bar and click "vibrate" like Samsung / Huawei had... 

Any suggestions? Note this isn't just always driving but just generally in bed watching YouTube video - I have to stupidly adjust the volume one way or the other to put it on vibrate.

Cheers,
Sam
