Is a one time alarm possible?

I have the pixel 3a. I use alarms a lot to keep track of meetings, appointments, etc.

Some of my alarms are repeating alarms, and some are just one-offs. But when I set a one-off alarm, even after I dismiss it, it still appears (and clutters up) my list of alarms. Periodically I have to go in there and clean out all the alarms I never wanted to save in the first place. 

Isn't there a way to set just a one-time alarm that doesn't leave droppings in the alarm list?
