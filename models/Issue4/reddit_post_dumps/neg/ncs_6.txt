Sending messages via Google Assistant doesn't work, even though it says "Message sent."

Hey, I'm having trouble with sending messages via Google Assistant, and I'd appreciate any help with this. Namely, if I pull the assistant up and say "send message", I get the "who do you wanna message?" thing. I choose a contact, press "send", and then it says that the message has been sent. However, if I click on "Open SMS", nothing happens, the supposedly sent message doesn't appear in the Messages app, and people I've tried sending the message to also didn't actually receive anything.

I checked the Google Assistant settings, and access to SMS is enabled. I've also tried disabling it, rebooting, and then re-enabling it, but everything is still the same. Googling the issue doesn't get me anywhere, either, so if anyone knows how to fix this, that'd be great.
