Issue w. 4A (5G) and Wi-fi repeaters

Hi all, I'm having an interesting problem with my Pixel 4A (5G), and I'm running out of options here...

I am using a few wifi repeaters at home, because the walls are really thick and it's hard to get a good signal from the box when not in the same room.
With all my previous phones, the transition between the box and the repeaters worked just fine, but the Pixel has a peculiar behaviour there.
Instead of picking the best signal available, it systematically connects to one of the repeaters, even if the box is closer. This makes using the wifi impossible since I always end up with a very weak signal, even when the box is a few meters away. I tried resetting the phone, but to no avail. A weird detail is that when not connected to the wifi, the phone sees it in the wifi list with a very good connection. Only when I actually click on it to connect to it do the phone goes awry and uses the much farther repeater...

Any idea about how to solve that? Apart from that, the phone has been great so far.
Thanks !
