Spotify weird bug

Been having this weird issue where if I open spotify, it opens normally when the app isn't running in the background, but once it's in use and I go into my home screen and I go back to the app, there is no animation and just pops into the screen, I couldn't find this anywhere online so any help is appreciated, it may seem a very silly issue but it just looks ugly
