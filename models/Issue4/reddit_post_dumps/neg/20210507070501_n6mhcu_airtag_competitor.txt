Airtag competitor

Airtags work mostly by relying on the popularity of iOS - the little Bluetooth devices don't have their own gps units, but proximal apple devices report their location based on Bluetooth and uwb tech.

This would be a stupidly easy system for google to outcompete nearly overnight. All Android devices with google play services installed already have Nearby.

Nearby and its branding already work for Nearby share, and some other things that google kinda wiffed (maybe for paranoia over not wanting to seem creepy?).

But anyway, imagine this scenario:

1. MadeByGoogle makes little square shaped airtag things, or maybe they outright buy tile. "Nearby items" or something.

2. These devices use the already-existing Nearby function of google play services to work exactly like airtags, through the Find Device app that's also already on nearly all Android devices.

3. Run a tv ad or 2 about the things and announce them at their fall pixel event or something.

4. Overnight, you have a massive network of Android devices worldwide that can likely outcompete airtags given the prevalence of Nearby enabled devices.
