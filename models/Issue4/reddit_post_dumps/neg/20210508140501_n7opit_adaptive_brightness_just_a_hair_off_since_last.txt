adaptive brightness just a hair off since last update

anyone else? it's like, a little bit brighter and i keep turning it down when i notice it but it certainly isn't learning. hahaha

it's a little annoying, and it's a little more battery drain, obviously.

maybe i should just turn adaptive brightness off once and for all, but i always forget in sunny situations then then i can't see the damn screen to turn brightness up! anyway, seperate issue. lol
