Can I add extra authentication step to my Gmail and Gdrive on Pixel / android phone?

Basically, woke up to a realization that my Google mail, Docs and Drive are all in the open once my phone is unlocked. Sure handy in day-to-day life, but if my routine changes, I'd appreciate having the requirement to enter my credentials every time, just like on old school desktops. 

I've read on 2FA, Authy app and Yubikey, but those seem to target unauthorized access on the initial sign-in, where's what I am looking for is more  a way to protect certain apps in case someone gets their hands on my unlocked phone. Especially since Google apps are logged in by default, unlike say a banking app. 

Did anyone else have this concern and what are the options?
