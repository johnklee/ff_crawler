Google pixel 4 price and availability on eBay

I'm considering to upgrade my pixel 3a et pixel 4 because I need a powerful phone at low price. I play Pokemon go so I need a phone that can keep the game open in background. My pixel 3a is not strong enough to do it so I must change it. The awfull battery isn't an issue for me because I always have a charger with me because of Pokemon go. So my questions are can the pixel 4 price Increase soon and up to when I have the time to buy one on eBay before it gets everywhere out of stock? I don't really know how this market work so any response really help. ♥️
