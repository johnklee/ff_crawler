Interesting issue: "Alexa find my phone DOES NOT WORK WITH CALL SCREENING ON!"

Just what it says. Your phone won't make a single noise. 

I would have thought any engineer worth his salary would have figured this out in Beta and done something about it.

So, to screen or not to screen, that is the question.

I am leaning towards not screening since the rather long script begins with a Google advertisement.

Now this. 

Definitely finding issues with new "features" as we go along.

Oh and lens! Can anybody tell me why lens can only integrate one recognized feature at a time rather than looking at a gestalt of identifying marks to figure out what, say a car part, is?
