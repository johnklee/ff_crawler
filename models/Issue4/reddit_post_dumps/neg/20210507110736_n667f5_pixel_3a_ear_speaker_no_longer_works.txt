Pixel 3a ear speaker no longer works.

Hello, 

I spilled some liquid on my phone and it  went over the ear speaker. 

 The ear speaker stopped working, I tried drying it with hair dryer, and leaving it to dry on its own.  

That didn't work, so I opened it and replaced the speaker with a new spare part.  Still the issue is there.  Audio jack works fine.  Microphone and loud speaker work fine, just the ear speaker. 

 Should I still replace audio jack also, or anything else?
