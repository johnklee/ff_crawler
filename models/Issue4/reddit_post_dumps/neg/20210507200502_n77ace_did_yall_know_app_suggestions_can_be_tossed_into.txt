Did y'all know app suggestions can be tossed into the top right corner to block them from the home screen?

I didn't! I like app suggestions, but don't like having to go into settings to update the list when I swap out an app on my home screen.

Realized this is a thing by accident. Please forgive me if it's common knowledge!
