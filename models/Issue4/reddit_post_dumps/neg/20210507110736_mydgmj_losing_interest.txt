Losing interest....

Been a pixel fan since I got the pixel 3.  I now have a pixel 5 which without beating around the bush is riddled with bugs imo.

I don't understand how some smaller bugs are not fixed almost instantly.  For goodness sake it's a google phone running googles software.

Picture in picture constantly bugging and not being able to be moved from anywhere but bottom corner.

Bluetooth issues (pixel buds) are so hit or miss with noise gates and surrounding noises.

SMS / MMS disaster (no it's not as easy as asking my entire network of friends and family to switch over to another app.  The pixel 3 handled sms and mms 1000x better.  Videos are garbage and so are texted pictures.  I just don't get how it's not something that can be fixed... And before you say photos can't be sent at higher resolutions.. spare yourself it's a stupid lame excuse for how google is handling this.  Iphones handle sms chats better than pixels... And it's just not okay.

Photos are great but they're slowly falling off - I think I took better photos on pixel 3 to be fair.

Snapchat is horrendous and I get it's a third party app however, google knows loads use snapchat so make the app capable of taking advantage of post processing... Google is such a large company and they're doing nothing...

I love android and love the phone I'm just very frustrated with how poor some things are handled
