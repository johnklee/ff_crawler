Pixel 3 no longer taking a charge, any way to revive?

My Pixel 3 has been quirky for a bit regarding charging. It would only work with the OEM charger and cable. But that stopped working now too. Battery is completely dead and will not take a charge. I've replaced it with another, but wondering if there is any way I can retrieve info that is on the dead unit? Yes, I backed most of my stuff up to Google, but there's dome other stuff like downloads etc that I'd like to retrieve if at all possible. Anyone have luck reviving a completely dead battery that will not take a charge? I also tried wireless charging trying to rule out the charging port, but that is not working either.
