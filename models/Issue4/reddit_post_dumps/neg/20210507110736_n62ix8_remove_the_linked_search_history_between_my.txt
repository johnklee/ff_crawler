Remove the "linked" search history between my desktop chrome and my phone?

Hi, i've been noticing lately that my PIXEL actually has the built in search history that my PC has when I use chrome, it even gives me the option to add my credit card info in one-click and I never asked for that.

Is there anyway to disable that or have separate search history between my phone and my computer?
