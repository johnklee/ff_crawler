Yahoo emails not syncing on Pixel 4a (yeah I know, Yahoo mail lol)

We are in the process of putting our house on the market and simultaneously shopping for a new one. My wife is never one to change electronic habits so still uses her yahoo email for everything. Over the the past week or so we have noticed emails where she is CC'd on are not popping up on her phone even hours after sent. Yesterday I had a ton of realtor emails back and forth and CCd her on all. None showed. Last night turned on the laptop and her yahoo and they were all there. 

I checked the settings and it says to check for mail every 15 minutes. Any ideas?
