Pixel keeps muting itself

Hello, I have a Google pixel phone that I use for alarms and I constantly oversleep because of this phone. First I wake up very late then I notice that the alarm volume has magically been reset to mute. It was at maximum volume but now it's muted. I have turned off every setting that could influence the alarm volume (or just all of what I could find, like flip to shh for example) but still likes to mute itself. I am not talking about overall mute, it's the alarm volume bar specifically. Any help would be appreciated
