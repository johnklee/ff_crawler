Multiple usb-c devices at the same time?

I haven't been able to find an answer to these questions.

First, can you connect two or more usb-c devices to the Pixel at the same time? (Such as a separate camera and microphone)

Secondly, could you do this while an external battery pack is connected? I'm thinking of using a usb hub and having a battery pack and a camera/microphone connected to the phone.

I'm thinking of streaming on the go and would like to use my Pixel 5. I would rather use devices that are connected directly rather than bluetooth. I'm just not sure if I can do what I want to.
