My experience with Google RMA

 After repeated attempts to get my Pixel Buds 2 working properly I finally gave up on fixing the mic/audio dropouts and contacted Google for a return. To be fair to them they didn't quibble or do any more than basic troubleshooting, they issued a returns authorisation straight away and I shipped them back. Unfortunately it's been like pulling teeth trying to get my money back. As I write this they've had my faulty buds for 3 weeks, the first time I contacted them I was told that the refund would be issued within 14 days so I needed to wait that long before I contacted them. I got in touch today, on the 15th day, only to be told my case would need to be escalated to a higher support tier and they would "hopefully" be in touch within another 3 days.

I'm done buying Google hardware. I live in Europe, our consumer protections are great am I'm used to a much better standard of service. I had a faulty xbox controller within 11 months of purchase and MS shipped me a replacement as soon as they got confirmation that my return had been shipped to them. A premium product from a big company like google should come with premium customer service, there's no excuse for dragging out the process and leaving me without the product I paid for and the money I spent on it.

The Pixel Buds 2 were flawed from day 1 and the three people I know who bought them have all had the same problem. Google has yet to do anything to fix the issue and getting your money back is like pulling teeth, don't jump on the Buds A without waiting to see if they have any issues because if they do they may never be fixed.
