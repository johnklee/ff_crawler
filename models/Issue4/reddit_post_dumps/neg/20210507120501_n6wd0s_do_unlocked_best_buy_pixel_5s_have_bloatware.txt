Do Unlocked Best Buy Pixel 5s Have Bloatware?

I'm considering getting the Pixel 5 unlocked, and the Best Buy close to me has them in stock. I thought it would be nice to not wait a few days for shipping from Google and to just get it today instead. But considering the random software installed on my Note 9 I bought from T-Mobile, I want to be sure I'm getting the *exact* same phone from Best Buy as I would from Google (which I assume has no bloatware or unwanted services installed).

Thanks for your help!
