OG Pixel, will it get LineageOS 18/Android 11? or upgrade to Pixel 3/3a?

I did search around reddit and here and I didn't get an answer. 

Quick question for those in the know I'm sure. I'm deciding on either getting the battery replaced on my OG Pixel and using it until it dies, or upgrade to a Pixel 3/3a. I'm honestly wanting to get away from using my phone a lot and I'm not a power user. LineageOS 17 on the OG Pixel is quite smooth but I'm concerned about software support and longevity. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!
