Pixel 2: Stuck on Black Screen.

So my phone crashed and soft rebooted itself but it was missing the notifications bar so I did a hard reboot. Now the phone screen is staying black except with booting up and when holding the power button which is now showing a simplified power options showing only Shutdown, Reboot, and Lockdown. I can still feel vibrations. The phone is bootloader unlocked and I can access the bootloader.

What can I do to fix this? I've already tried factory restoring it (while keeping user data.)
