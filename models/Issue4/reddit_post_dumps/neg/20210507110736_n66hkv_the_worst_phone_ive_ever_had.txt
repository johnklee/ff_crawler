The worst phone I've ever had.

I have a pixel 2.

The phone turns off at random, if I have the camera on with any battery percentage it will turn off without fail if not plugged. If I'm using it generally it will turn off at literally any battery percentage, it could go at 99% or at 30% when I'm just browsing apps and playing a game. 

 The software will sometimes bug out and log me out of games, especially if I'm switching between apps. If I'm using it horizontal these gray bars for the notification bar will stay there permanently if I swipe down to see the time, same thing happens with the navigation buttons. 

Switching through apps a lot of the time will freeze up the phone and then take me back to the home screen. If I try to open the app that was closed out it stays on a frozen screen, always have to close it and reopen it. 

There's a few other bugs and issues but those are my main complaints. Never had a phone run this dysfunctionally, I've had really slow phones before but this is so unfucking godly infuriating to use and I can't afford to buy another at the moment. 

Just a rant on my pixel 2.
