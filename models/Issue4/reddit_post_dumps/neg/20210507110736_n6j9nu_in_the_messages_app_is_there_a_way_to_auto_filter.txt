In the Messages app is there a way to auto filter to spam any text messages that contain a specific text?

I noticed that every single text that gets through the spam filter that should be filtered out as spam on my Pixel 4a contains an opening to the text like

`// @`
`Some message`


If there's a way to filter out messages beginning with that // @ then I'd see virtually no spam texts. I guessing there isn't but thought it was worth seeing to make sure. Thank you!
