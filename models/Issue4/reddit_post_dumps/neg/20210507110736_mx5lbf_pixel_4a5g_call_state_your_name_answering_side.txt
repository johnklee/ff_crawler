Pixel 4a5G - Call "State your name" answering side "press 2"

New Pixel 4a5G and Cricketwireless, if that matters. When I make a call to a person in my contacts, the phone app says "say your name", less than a second later it connects and the called party has to press 1 or 2 to accept. I don't like this, is there a way to turn it off? Having to press anything is not good for handsfree driving.
