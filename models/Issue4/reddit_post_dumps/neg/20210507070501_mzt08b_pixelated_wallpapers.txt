Pixelated Wallpapers

I've downloaded multiple wallpapers online & when I view them in the camera app & the set wallpaper preview page, they're in the resolution I downloaded them in. However once I set that picture as my wallpaper, it is very pixelated when I look at it in my home & lock screen. Is there anyway to set the wallpaper in a high resolution?
