NFC suddenly not working, cannot even be turned on?

Hi everyone,

Pixel 5 owner here. Never had any problems with it whatsoever, haven't touched any settings, and all of a sudden today when I went to pay for something, it says that my NFC is turned off. 

I tapped to turn it on and nothing happens. I go into setting and I cannot even turn it of. The section is greyed out and cannot be switched on or off.

Anyone have any suggestions or solutions as to what has happened???
