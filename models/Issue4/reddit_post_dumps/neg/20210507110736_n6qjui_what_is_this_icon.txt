What is this icon?

My phone has been acting weird all day but this dilemma just happened earlier in the day.

What is the icon that looks like a zig zag pulse with a line crossing it mean? It's between the battery and LTE icons at the time of this writing. Also my camera stopped working all a sudden. I have restarted and shutdown/reboot with no avail.

Thank You.
