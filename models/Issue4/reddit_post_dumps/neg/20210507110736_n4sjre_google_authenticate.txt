Google Authenticate

Hi all, this isn't actually a problem with a Google pixel phone...but I have no idea where to go to fix it!

I have recently purchased a Google pixel, I'm need to transfer my Google Authenticate over from a now broken Samsung...the only way I can see to transfer my account is by taking a screenshot of the QR code in the old phone....I replaced the old phone as I trapped it in a car door (doh) so I can't see the QR code....I've tried a screen shot but you can't screen shot a Google QR code...

Any logical ideas?!
