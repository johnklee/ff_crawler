Yeah so ever since my Pixel 2 XL stopped receiving updates, it has COMPLETELY started to glitch the hell out.

When I first got this phone, I was amazed at how lightning fast it was. And what was even better? *IT STAYED THAT WAY FOR YEARS!*. But now that I'm no longer receiving much needed security updates? Oh it's a fucking nightmare. Apps completely freeze causing it to reboot, I get a system UI isn't responding message 50 times a day, it lags like nothing I've ever seen, the problems just keep coming and coming and coming. I value pixel phones more than anything else on the market. They have great cameras and work incredibly well right out of the gate. But if this is going to be the future of these phones (ie 3 year lifespan before you quit receiving updates and it inevitably shits the bed) then I'm gonna have to move on to something else.
