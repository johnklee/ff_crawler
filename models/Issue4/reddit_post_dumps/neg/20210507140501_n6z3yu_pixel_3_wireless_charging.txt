Pixel 3 wireless charging

Currently using a pixel 2, just picked up a refurbished pixel 3 for $100 to keep around as a spare in case my phone dies. Started thinking about actually using it and keeping the P2 as a backup instead. Anyway, I was reading something about google limiting wireless charging to 5w on non-google-stand chargers, but that was a couple years ago. Are there any wireless chargers that will charge at the full 10w now, or is my only choice the Google pixel stand? Thanks!
