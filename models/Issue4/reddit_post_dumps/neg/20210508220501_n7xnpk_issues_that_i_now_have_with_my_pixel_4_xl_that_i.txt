Issues that I now have with my pixel 4 XL that I didn't used to... With my pixel 2xl

Now I'm pretty sure you used to able to hold the power button and press the screenshot button but now you have to fling the screen up and then press screenshot. This is annoying if you are taking a picture of a YouTube video which it will pause. The previous way didn't pause the YouTube video. Anyone else remember this?

Also not being able to see notification previews such as the message of a text on the lock screen. Which you used to be able to do on the pixel 2 XL. 

I never used to have issues with the battery on the pixel 2 XL but on the pixel 4xl I now have trouble charging it consistently. I have the 50% problem with my pixel 4 XL. 

Another thing is that when listening to Spotify you used to see the album cover on the lock screen which no longer happens on the pixel 4 XL. 

I wish they would add the ability to switch between mono and stereo on the tiles panel instead of having to go to the settings. I do actually use the mono sound option often as I listen to music at work with only one earphone (not aloud to use 2). Makes music much nicer to listen to on mono mode. Quite annoying switching it in the settings everyday and turning it off when I get in my car. 

These issues are quite annoying to me on a daily basis which is a shame as I love the phone.

Anyway thanks for reading my rant.
