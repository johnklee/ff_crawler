Pixel 4XL to Pixel 5 Users; Screen Comparison?

I recently went from the Pixel 4XL to the Pixel 5..  for those who have done the same, what is your take on the screen differences?  I know that the PPI and resolutions are statistically different, but the Pixel 5 fonts look hazy compared to the 4XL

I installed a screen protector ([https://www.verizon.com/products/zagg-invisibleshield-glass-elite-screen-protector-with-visionguard-plus-for-google-pixel-5/](https://www.verizon.com/products/zagg-invisibleshield-glass-elite-screen-protector-with-visionguard-plus-for-google-pixel-5/)) and wanted to ensure it wasn't the blue filter or something causing the difference.
