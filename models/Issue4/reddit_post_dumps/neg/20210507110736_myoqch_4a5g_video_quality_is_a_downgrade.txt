4a5g video quality is a downgrade?

So, I recently bought a Pixel 4a 5g. I was a OnePlus 6 user and still have the phone with me.
I was so excited to use the Pixel because of the exclusive features being Google's line. And yes, especially the camera. There isn't the unlimited storage support for phones other than the Pixels, so yeah.

The photos from the Pixel didn't stand out at all. I was shocked and downright started suspecting if the quality was even comparable to OnePlus 6 or not. When I went ahead to record a video, there was no doubt.
The videos were absolutely not 1080p or 4k, by a long shot. I don't know if there has recently been an update or something else changed, but the video quality is not acceptable at all for a Pixel.

I tried video calling friends on Signal, WhatsApp, and Duo, and each one of them was able to make out the difference between the Pixel call and the OnePlus call.
Is it just me or anyone else facing the same issue? Or is there something else to this? Any sort of input would be appreciated. Thanks.
