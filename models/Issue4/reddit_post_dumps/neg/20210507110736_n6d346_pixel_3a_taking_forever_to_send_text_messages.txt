Pixel 3a taking FOREVER to send text messages, sends non consecutively

For about 2 days now my Pixel 3a which I got September 2019 gas been taking AGES to send texts, even with full bars if service. I can access the internet fine and send messages via WiFi no problem but texting is actually terrible.

Is there anyone else having this issue? I'd rather not hard reset if I don't have to and buying another phone right now seems foolish as I'd rather try to wait it out until the next pixel gets anounce, but this text message thing is making my phone borderline unusable.
