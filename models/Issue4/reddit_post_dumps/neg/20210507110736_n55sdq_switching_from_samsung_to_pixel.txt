Switching from Samsung to Pixel

I switched from Samsung due to the fact of them putting ads throughout there base apps and other products like there tv.
I currently have the pixel 5 and I love it. And for the tv I just got the Google TV Chromecast.
If I'm paying around $2,000-$5,000 for products, they best not be bombarding me with ads..
