Pixel 3 randomly bricked. Anyone have a similar experience?

I've been so happy with this phone, so much so that my upgrade was available in November but I was content with the 3. The phone has been in a case it's entire life, no sketchy apps or rooting, wasn't over heating, it just wouldn't turn back on. I was watching Hulu, casting to my tv at the time. I grabbed my phone to pause the show and it acted like the battery was dead. I tried charging it for days, factory resets with the buttons, nothing would do anything. Verizon wasn't any help, the sales person told me "Sometimes you can just hit a button wrong and they do that." I figured I wasn't gonna get anywhere after that. All in all I still love Pixel phones. I just got a 5, but I'd like to see if anyone has similar experiences. I couldn't find much online but if my P5 does the same thing I'm moving on.
