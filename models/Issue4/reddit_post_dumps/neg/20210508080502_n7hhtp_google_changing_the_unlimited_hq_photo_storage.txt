Google changing the unlimited HQ photo storage policy after June 1st 2021.

Anyone else seen this? I just got the notification to update Google photos and saw it and I haven't seen it posted here, it seems to affect all Pixels regardless of when it was purchased.

Edit: thanks to everyone for confirming it doesn't affect Pixel.
