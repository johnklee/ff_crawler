Pixel 4a 5G touch sensitivity in corners broken again in May update?

Is anyone else experiencing this issue again? It was prevalent a few months ago - tapping close to the corner of the screen (e.g. 3 small dots menu in YouTube app when fullscreen) does not register touch. It was fixed for a while, but since the new security update the issue is back again for me.
