Pixel 5 free photo uploads - a question about the quality

As Google offers free unlimited high quality photo uploads for the pixel 5 - what is the quality of these high quality photo uploads? My photos on the p5 have been between 10-15mb and of a very good quality, how much deterioration will these photos face when uploaded in high quality to Google photos?
