Pixel 4A updated with today's Security Update. Phone is now running very slow and touch sensitivity is off.

I'm unsure if it's a coincidence, or if it's actually the update. 
I have restarted the phone and it hasn't improved the issue. I've also checked and made sure the apps it's affecting are up to date. 

As an example, after the update when messaging people on Facebook Messenger, my typing isn't being picked up correctly and the bubble keeps closing itself. 
Also, when split screening apps my phone has noticeable lag. 

The phone itself is only a couple of months old and hasn't been damaged (no dropping, water exposure etc).


Any ideas on what I should or could do? Has this happened to anyone else (I suspect the Messenger issue would be most visible if it was)?
