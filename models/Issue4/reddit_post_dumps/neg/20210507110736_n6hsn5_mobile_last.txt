Dear Google:

You invented Android, and yet in 2021 I still have to use my laptop for creating a new label, creating a calendar event from an email,... and I'm sure you know the list. 

You fully support my six-year-old, $35, Raspberry Pi 3B, but not my thousand-dollar Google Pixel 3xl.  Think about that for a moment.

Seriously, do you want people to use Android or not?
