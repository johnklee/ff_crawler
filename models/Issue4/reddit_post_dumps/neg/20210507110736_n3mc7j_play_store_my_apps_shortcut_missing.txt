Play Store My Apps Shortcut missing

Recently after restarting my phone, I noticed that the My Apps Shortcut for the Play Store was missing.

I'm using a Pixel 4 XL with Android 11.

The My Apps shortcut does appear on other devices I have with Android 11 like the OnePlus 9 Pro.

I tried rebooting my phone again to see if that would help but the My Apps shortcut is still missing.

Other app shortcuts like Brave, Spotify etc are still working.

**Update/Edit:** As u/pimfram suggested in the comments,

>Try disabling Play Store and enabling. That allowed me to get the shortcut back. Google support suggested it after I'd contacted them the other week.

That seemed to work: [https://i.imgur.com/kaiM2sQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/kaiM2sQ.png)
