Best Time To Buy Pixel 4a

I need to get a new phone for myself as well as for each of my boys. I'm currently on a Moto Z3 with a rapidly dying battery and my boys are on bare bones phones that were free from Verizon. The latter suited them when we got them 2 years ago, but it's time for an upgrade. I've settled on getting each of us our own Pixel 4a. (I briefly looked at the 4a 5G for me, but I don't think I need the additional features for the increased price.)

Right now, Best Buy has the phones for $300 - $100 less than Verizon. I want to get the phones before June 1st so that we keep the unlimited Google photos, but I know that Google will be making an announcement soon about the Pixel 5a. Do you think that the price for the Pixel 4a will drop much between now and the end of May? Or am I better off getting the new phones now while they're still in stock?
