Nice cases for the Google Pixel 4?

Hi all! Sorry for the random post, just wanted to see if anyone had any advice. I've been looking for nice, sturdy cases for my Google pixel 4 and haven't really had any luck. I like the style of brands like Casetify etc. However they don't make options for any of the pixel phones. Thanks in advance! 

P.s. please do not suggest Amazon as I've already been told to go there and I don't shop there for ethical reasons xx
