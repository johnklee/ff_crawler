Pixel 4xl and pokemon go

Hi,

I have a pixel 4xl and it has been great so far. I'm hating the extra notifications when I get a message like everyone is, but photos are great and it's smooth.

Anyways, this question is specific for people who play pokemon go and use a pokeball plus or pocket egg. The past few months my pokeball plus will take FOREVER to connect. I have to allow access to contacts and whatever and even then it won't connect. Sometimes it does and works well. It's random what the day will bring.
So I but a pocket egg and it connects the same way but it connects every time, except it drops connection every 2-5 minutes which sucks be sure I use it to run 7-10miles everyday and I just want it to catch pokemon while I run and have my phone away.

Does anyone know how to fix this or make the connection more reliable and consistent?
Thanks in advance!
