Saying Goodbye to Pixel

I've had a Pixel 1, 2, 3 and 4XL. I loved them all (although the 4XL a little less... Faciial recognition is no substitute for a fingerprint reader).

The 4XL was killed by a Google update (stuck rebooting every few minutes) and the entire support process can be described as "Do a factory reset", "No? Ok, you're out of warranty, tough shit".

So... I went to pick up the next obvious choice the Pixel 5.

Except now apparently it's a massive _downgrade_ in terms of hardware.

WTF Google?

So much for a premium flagship phone.

So I bit the bullet and picked up a Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G which arrives tomorrow and has a processor that's better than my current phone.

And when you get into the details, it's not just the CPU... RAM speeds, SoC, all of it is a massive downgrade with the Pixel 5.

Are Google trying to kill off their premium line or ... ?
