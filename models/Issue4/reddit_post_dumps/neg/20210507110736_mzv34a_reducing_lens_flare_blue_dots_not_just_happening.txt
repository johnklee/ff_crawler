Reducing Lens Flare ? blue dots, not just happening in night sight mode

Hi there,

Does anyone have any tips for reducing lense flare/those blue dots that show up when you take pictures at night?  This has been happening even when it's not in night sight mode.  Would having a protective lens cover help or hinder this feature?  Is there something I can change in settings?

Edit: I have 4a 5G and I don't recall this ever being an issue on my OG pixel or pixel 3
