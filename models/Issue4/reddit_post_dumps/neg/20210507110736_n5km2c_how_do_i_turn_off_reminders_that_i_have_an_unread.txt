How do I turn off reminders that I have an unread text?

My Pixel 5 gives me a notification (sound, vibrate and pop up) when I receive a new text - that's fine.

But then every couple hours, if I haven't opened up the text, it will give me ANOTHER notification as if I received the text for the first time. Super confusing.

Also, when I go and open the messages app, it will give me a text notification about the unread texts AGAIN! 

Anyone know how to turn these extra notifications off? I only want to receive the text notification one time, when I first receive the text. If I don't have time to respond, I avoid reading new texts right away.
