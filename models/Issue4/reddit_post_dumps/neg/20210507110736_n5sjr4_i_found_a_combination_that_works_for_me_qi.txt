I found a combination that works (for me) QI wirless charging for Pixel 4a5g

I've never had wireless charging before, but it's quite nice and convenient. May not be the best there is but this combo works reliably (for me). This combo charges at \~1000-1100 mah, whereas the pixel wired quick charger is \~3300-3400 mah. BTW, I used Ampere to get these numbers. IMO, wireless charging is a good overnight charger, not for quick charging. 

[Nillkin Qi Receiver (Long version)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CVY818V) , [INIU Wireless Charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LVSFN4X) 

I'm using the long version of the receiver, the short one placed the receiver to low in the stand to activate charging (I had to use a spacer to physically move the phone up for the "short" one to work). The long version positions it just in the right spot and I only see a very small sliver of the receiver in the fingerprint hole of my case. 

I would also suggest one of the thicker cases, I'm using a [Spigen Liquid Air Armor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08D6429BD) , this way I can leave the receiver plugged in and the case is thick enough around the charging hole to protect the plug. 

I tried a different foldable stand but had to many bright lights on for my taste (although it did work decently). 

I also tried a [MyMax](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XD75XY3) receiver, which promised a higher charge. It was a higher charge and would charge at about 1300 mah, but about 5-10 seconds later the phone would just stop charging and wouldn't start again until I removed the phone and placed it back on the charging stand, (with the same results 5-10 seconds later). 

This isn't a review, only what worked for me, hope it helps someone!
