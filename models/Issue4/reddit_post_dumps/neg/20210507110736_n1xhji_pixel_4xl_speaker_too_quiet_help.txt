Pixel 4xl speaker too quiet. Help?

We have two identical Pixel 4 XL phones.

The speaker on one of them only plays about 20% the volume of the other.

Can't figure out how to fix it. Have tried a few things I saw online but nothing has worked.

For clarification. The speaker plays fine for music and notifications but not for calls
