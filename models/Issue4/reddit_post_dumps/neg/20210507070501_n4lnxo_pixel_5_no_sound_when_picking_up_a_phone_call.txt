Pixel 5: No sound when picking up a phone call

Hello everyone,

Kind of a weird one but, I was wondering if someone has this issue.Everytime I get a phone call and pick up,  I get no sound. I think people hear me but not the otherway around. Changing from earspeaker to speaker does nothing. Only solution I have found is to end the call and call back.I also tried shutting down my bluetooth without succes.

Anyone  strugling with this or  with a possible solution?

Thanks in advance,

Jack  


EDIT: Factory reset phone to no avail. Did an update of the phone app in the playstore and that seems to have helped.   
Other people reported that disabling wifi calls fixes the problem if your provider supports that.
