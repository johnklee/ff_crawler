Weird shit going on with my phone (Discord/Spotify)

For some reason, within the past week or two, discord and Spotify refuse to play nicely with each other. I have a Pixel 4a and got it at launch, and I have never experienced anything similar to this. I've searched around quite a bit for this issue and can't find any information. I would assume anyone with the same device would be my best chance to get help.


I've tried

-Restating my phone

-Force closing both apps

-Force closing or swiping discord out of the recent apps page (Works temporarily, until I need to open it again) 


Whenever Discord is open in the background, Spotify will not load anything and says that there is no internet connection. If I swipe Discord away or force stop it, and then return to Spotify it instantly loads everything and acts normally again.


Anyone else having these issues? If so, any permanent fixes?

This is the strangest thing I've had happen on any phone ever.
