Help with next phone decision?

Hey friends, I'm looking for some advice. I was a happy user of a Pixel 3 for two years. Loved the camera-- for me it's the most important item on a phone. Rest of phone function was fine.

That phone died, and now Google is offering me a refurbished Pixel 3 for $79, or "up to $200 credit" for another phone. I've read this subreddit enough to be suspicious of that. Also, I just noticed [Boingboing.net](https://Boingboing.net)'s store has refurbished Pixel 4XL's on sale for $300.

I'm tempted to just take the Pixel 3, since that is the cheapest option, and I was delighted with the pictures that the camera took. 

Do you guys think paying $220 more for a Pixel 4XL is worth it? How do the cameras stack up? Any other recommendations I haven't thought of?

My priorities are: 1) Camera performance  2) Cost   3)Everything else.

Thanks for any opinions or advice you can offer!
