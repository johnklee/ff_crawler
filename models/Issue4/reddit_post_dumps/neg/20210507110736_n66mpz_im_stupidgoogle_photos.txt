I'm stupid...Google Photos

I can't seem to figure out how to find a view that allows me to collectively see ALLL photos on my phone. So far I can only view photos in categorical view which I really dislike. My brain works to know when and where, separate from what Google perceives as how I want my photos categorized. Any help would be amazing. Thanks in advanced!
