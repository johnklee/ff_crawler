a question about notifications

it's important that i be notified by a certain app, but sometimes it won't notify me until the screen turns on. i have the app set not to optimize it's battery usage, and the phone is not in battery saver mode or do not disturb. how do i prevent this from happening? 

device is a pixel 4a 5g running android 11
