Sirui 18mm wide lens

I'm on Pixel4a and I'm wondering what's your experience with Sirui lenses. I have two questions:
1. Is the quality of pictures worse with the lens on?
2. Is mounting the lens with the clip enough or do I really need to buy a case?

It's 2021 and external lenses are kinda getting out of fashion I know, but there's literally no need to upgrade my Pixel4a so I've been considering buying the wide lens.
