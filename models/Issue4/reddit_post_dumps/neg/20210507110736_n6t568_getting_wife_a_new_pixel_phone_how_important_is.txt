Getting wife a new Pixel phone. How important is IP rating vs 3.5mm jack to you?

Hello,

My wife is currently rocking my old Pixel 2 which, till this day, I am still jealous about the photo quality that comes from that phone! I would like to upgrade her phone to either a Pixel 4a 5g or a Pixel 5. I'm leaning more on a 4a 5g just because she prefers the 3.5mm jack. But we have an adventurous 2.75 year old son who can be aggressive with the phone. Water, dust, poo (lol), pee might be an issue. 

Wanted to get a general feel of how people choose between the two devices. The primary goal is the camera and it looks like they are the same for both. So I guess it boils down to these simple essentials.

Thanks for reading!
