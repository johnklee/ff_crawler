Missing bottom "back" button. Any solutions?

Hi all, I just got a P5 and so far I'm loving it. I upgraded from my old Essential Phone PH-1 and it had a more convenient (imo) back "button" that just lived at the bottom of the screen. I am having trouble getting used to the swipe from the side to go back a screen. Is there any solution to add the back button to the bottom?
