Pixel 5 - not receiving incoming calls

Hi everyone,

Since yesterday I canÂ´t receive incoming calls on my Pixel 5. Outgoing calls are no issue but whoever tries to call me only hears "not available".

latest update did not change anything, also a factory reset did not help.

Anyone with the same issue at the moment or ideas how to resolve this?

best
