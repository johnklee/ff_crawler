How accurate is Google Fit on a Pixel 3a?

Pandemic life has had me more sedentary than normal so I wanted to start tracking things to get out there. Google Fit was easy because well I already have a Pixel 3a. I also bought a cheap Amazfit Band 5 to use as well knowing I like to go for walks without my phone sometime and today was my first day of using both and despite having my phone in my Pixel 3a in my pocket all day the Pixel is saying I've done 1100 steps so far and the but the Amazfit is saying I've done  569 steps. 

So is Google Fit just really bad or should I return this band and get something like a Fitbit?
