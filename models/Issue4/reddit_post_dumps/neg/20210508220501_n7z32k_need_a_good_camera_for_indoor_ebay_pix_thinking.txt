Need a good camera for indoor eBay pix thinking of going from LG V20 to Pixel 2/3. Opinions?

I currently have an LG V20 and while I love the phone, I think the camera is shit especially when I try to take indoor pictures for eBay stuff.

It takes forever for it to 'focus' and the pictures look out-of-focus anyway.

I'm looking at the Pixel 2/3 line (4/5 are too much for me) because I've heard wonderful things about the camera in indoor light according to reviews.

Based on what I've read in this Subreddit, I'm not so sure anymore.

I know people tend to complain more than praise but what say you about the Pixel 2/3 units?

Thanks!
