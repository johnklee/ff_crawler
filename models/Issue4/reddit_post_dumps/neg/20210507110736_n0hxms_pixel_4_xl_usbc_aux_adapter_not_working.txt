Pixel 4 XL USB-C aux adapter not working

I have a 4XL and cannot get the USB-c to aux adapter to work. I've tried several dongles, including one recommended by Google. None work. 

I am wanting to plug my phone into my car's aux port (bluetooth not available in my car).  I also want to add a corded microphone for video recording. 

Any advice?
