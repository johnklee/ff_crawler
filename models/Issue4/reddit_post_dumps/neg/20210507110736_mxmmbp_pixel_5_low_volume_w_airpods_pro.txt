Pixel 5 Low Volume w/ AirPods Pro

Pixel 5 User - experiencing low maximum volume with the AirPods Pros. I've tried most everything on the internet including disabling absolute volume in developer settings. This does not fix my problem.

Do any other Pixel 5 users experience the same? Or have a magic fix?
