Digital wellbeing not recording usage

Hi all, 

I have been using and enjoying the digital wellbeing feature for a while now however all of a sudden it's stopped working? It's not recording any usage on my phone i.e. it says I've used my phone for 0 minutes today. 

I double checked and daily device usage permissions are still enabled. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this? 

Thanks!
