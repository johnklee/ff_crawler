Refurbished pixel 5

So I received my replacement pixel 5 last Saturday. 

I was super excited to finally have a pixel 5 that operates correctly.

To my disappointment the replacement is worse than the original, it won't stay on for more than a minute. I can't believe it . 

I honestly can't say a good thing about pixel 5 ,and after  3 hours of being transferred around  the Google team with no outcome as yet.I've not got much good to say there either . 

Super frustrating.
