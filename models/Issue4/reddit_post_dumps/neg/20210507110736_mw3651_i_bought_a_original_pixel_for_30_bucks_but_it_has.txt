I bought a original pixel for 30 bucks but it has some issues... Could they be fixed?

I bought a Google pixel for 30 bucks, the battery is good I can use up to almost six hours just using it throughout the day but the mic along with the headphone jack and speakers do not work. Using Bluetooth headphones work but just using it to listen to music or videos. Any possible fixes or I have to deal with it?
