PSA - How to fix connection issues between a Pixel and a Tile Bluetooth Finder

Posting this to help others out in the future, as my own Googling only resolved this after finding a very obscure Reddit comment that was several years old!

If you are having issues trying to connect between a Pixel and a Tile (Pixel 5 and Tile Pro, in my case) - such as dropped connection, slow connection speed, intermittent/garbled ringing, then you may need to change your Pixel's AVRCP version.

My Pixel 5 defaults to v1.5, but dropping it down to v1.4 fixed all the issues I was having.  The steps to do this are as follows:

1. Go to settings --> about phone --> tap build number 7 times to enable developer options
2. Go to settings --> system --> advanced --> developer options
3.  Scroll down to bluetooth AVRCP version
4.  Change from 1.5 (default) to 1.4

And that's it!  Seems the change sticks if you then subsequently turn off developer options, too.

Hopefully this helps someone out, Tile customer support were totally stumped and assumed a faulty Tile!!!
