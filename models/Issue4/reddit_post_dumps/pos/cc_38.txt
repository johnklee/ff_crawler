I am having issues with Bluetooth connections dropping on my Pixel 3a.

My connection to both my JVC head unit and a Targus Bluetooth speaker drop after a few minutes. In addition, neither device will auto-connect when powered up. I've used these devices with my 1st Gen Pixel and other Android phones over the years.

I believe it's a firmware or software bug on the 3a. Any ideas?
