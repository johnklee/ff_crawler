Pixel 3a popping/crackle noise from videos and music

So I was finding that the speaker of the pixel 3a makes a popping noise from its speaker when playing a YouTube video or playing music from Spotify. I originally thought it was a hardware defect but to my surprise it makes the same noise from multiple multiple bluetooth speakers which tells me that this is a software issue.

Also tried factory resetting, my device is with Koodo mobile in Canada and on latest firmware from Google.

Anyone else having the same issue?
