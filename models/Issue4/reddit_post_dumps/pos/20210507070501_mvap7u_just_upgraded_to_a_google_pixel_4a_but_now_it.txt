Just upgraded to a Google Pixel 4a, but now it won't work with my car stereo?

Hi all, hoping someone can help

I recently upgraded to a 4a 5g after having the same iPhone 5 for as long as I can remember. I don't use my phone for much except for calls, texts, and Spotify. I drive a 2005 ford connect with, from what I can tell, the original radio. With the iPhone I just used to plug my usb charger into the usb port on the radio and music would play straight from Spotify, and I could skip pause etc. from the radios controls. 

Now I've upgraded and bought a cable that has a usb on one end and a usbc on the other, both ends fit into the phone and radio and it can be used as a charger. When I plug it in the radios display says 'usb not recognised' and nothing plays. 

I've also tried it in my girlfriend's car, a newer ford fiesta. It has Bluetooth sync though I haven't tried that as I would have to desync her phone, and my car doesn't have Bluetooth anyway. When I try to plug it in with the usb it says 'device locked, please unlock and reconnect your device.' My phone is unlocked and I've tried reconnecting it with no luck. 

Do I need to buy a new radio for my car? I don't want to waste my money if it might not work anyway. I could also buy an aux cable, but then I wouldn't be able to use the radios controls to control the phones music. 

Am I just missing something obvious? I hope so as it will be very annoying if I've spent all this money on a new phone and it won't work for one of the main uses I have for it!

Hope someone can help!
