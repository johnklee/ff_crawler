Pixel 4a Bluetooth turns itself off then back on again, seems like the Bluetooth function crashes then restarts itself

It's happened twice to me, and have seen a couple other people talking about similar problems. This is quite worrying, as I love every part of this phone and I don't want this to be a negative for me
