Pixel 4a 5g Bluetooth issues

I have been having issues with Bluetooth connectivity with the new pixel 4a 5g. 1st it started with my Fitbit where the app would occasionally not find the device and I would need to forget and add the Fitbit again. More recently it has issues where the Bluetooth connection to car audio or wireless earphones keeps dropping whenever I switch between apps like spotify and Google maps or podcasts and Strava. Anyone else experience this issue? Any recommendations on how to fix this
