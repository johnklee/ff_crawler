Bluetooth issue with Pixel 5

I recently switched to a Pixel 5 and I'm having issues with Bluetooth streaming audio on my 2017 440xi GC.

The phone will connect and call functions work.
It shows that the phone is connected for Bluetooth audio and I'm able to select it as a media source, but there is no sound.

I tried multiple music apps and the Pixel 5 works fine with my 2013 Ford F150.

I did some research and have tried the following with no luck:

- Updated iDrive SW to the latest version
- On my phone, changed the Bluetooth AVRCP Version to 1.4, 1.5 (default), and 1.6. I restarted the phone after every change.
- On my phone, disabled Bluetooth A2DP hardware offload setting. I restarted the phone after making the change.

I would appreciate it if anyone could offer any tips or tricks to get this working!
