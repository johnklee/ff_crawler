Constant Bluetooth disconnects with Pixel 4 XL and Pixel 2

Hi, I am having a constant Bluetooth disconnection problem since the recent updates. Prior to that it was fine and I was using Mimo with my Pixel 2. I upgraded to a Pixel 4 XL and the timelapse function and regular shooting functions are unreliable. Bluetooth drops out and things have to be restarted and disconnected. It seems to be a consistent issue with the Mimo app only, as regular timelapse and shooting is fine with the default camera app on my phones. I would like to use Mimo for the active track functions though.

Can DJI please look into this? I note there are other posts on this forum with users reporting Bluetooth unreliability since the recent updates.

I have tried the following:

- Disable all WiFi in home
- Disable all signal from nearby phones, essentially putting them into airplane mode
- Uninstalling the DJI Go 4 app
- Restarting Bluetooth and repairing
- Ensuring all batteries are fully charged

Please help!
