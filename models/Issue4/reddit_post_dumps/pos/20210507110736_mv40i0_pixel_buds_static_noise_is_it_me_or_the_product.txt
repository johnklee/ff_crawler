Pixel Buds Static Noise? Is it me or the product?

I purchased a pair of pixel buds, from the moment I started using it, the background has a persistent static noise which is audible if other things are playing and stops when whatever is playing stops. I contacted with customer service, and after all the troubleshootings, it was still there, so I returned that one and ordered a new pair. The new pair arrived with the exact same issue. At this point, I'm starting to wonder if this is my pickiness? Is every pair like this? But I really don't think so because I think it is very audible, especially when I'm in a quiet room, and it can be heard even with music playing on top. Also, I don't hear this static noise on other much cheaper bluetooth headphones. Is this just how this product is? If so, it's really horrible that a $180 headphone has this issue that most much cheaper ones don't even have. 

Does everyone hear this noise? Has anyone succeeded in fixing this issue? I like every other thing about this product, but this one noise is just really major. Any help or information here is extremely appreciated. Thanks!
