Adaptive Sound is Insane on the 4a 5G

I'm in the car, listening to music on full blast on my phone, and it sounds like a Bluetooth speaker.

It's loud (really loud), it's *punchy*, and it's draining my battery just a little quicker than I'd like.

Enable Adaptive Sound if you haven't already. It's fucking insane.
