Pixel 3 XL - Bluetooth Keeps Stopping

Hi, I bought a 3 XL two weeks ago and it's a great phone

Since last week I keep getting the error Bluetooth Keeps Stopping

The prompt keeps happening every 5 seconds and the phone is near unusable

I've tried the following:
Multiple restarts*
Switching off the phone overnight*
Reset network settings
Switching off Bluetooth Scanning and Location Services and restarting*
Factory Reset*

Solutions marked with a * would give me a 2-3  hour fix but it doesn't always work

Furthermore it's not a foolproof fix and it's frustrating to keep doing it every few hours

I see that it's not uncommon but no permanent fix is available
