Specific Bluetooth TWS earbuds disconnect and reconnect every 30 sec only during calls.

My Bluetooth 5.0 TWS (Monster Clarity 102 plus Airlinks) disconnect after 20 sec on any kind of call (normal, WhatsApp, Discord) in my Pixel 5, and then connects back.
It repeats too do that in cycles of about 30 sec.
I tried the support article to change Bluetooth AVRCP and MAP versions to 1.6,1.4 respectively and reboot the phone, but it didn't help.
The Airlinks work fine on OnePlus 7 With Android 11 phone.
Anker Liberty Neo earbuds Work fine with my Pixel 5.
