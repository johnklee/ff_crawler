Pixel 4 - problem in Bluetooth telling apps it's connected/disconnected? Or problem in apps?

I have Pixel 4 with Android 11. I've noticed recently (actually might be an issue for the recent year or two) that sometimes, apps I have that should trigger by BT being connected/disconnected - don't always get triggered:

1. In the past, I had tried many music players which failed to start playing music right when I'm connected via BT to my car. Today I use [Musicolet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.krosbits.musicolet&hl=en&gl=US), and even this one sometimes fail to start playing.
2. In the past, I used an app ("Find Bluetooth Devices", [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ellevsoft.findbluetoothdevices&hl=en&gl=US)) to remember where I've parked, by remembering BT state changes. I've noticed that over the past year, it sometimes fails to do it. So I also tried another one ("Parking", [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=il.talent.parking)), and this one also sometimes fails.

Is there some known issue of Bluetooth as a trigger on Pixel 4, or in general?

I've read many issues related to Bluetooth, but not sure if this is one of them.

Is it perhaps some new restriction on Android, that could cause apps not to wake up due to this trigger?

EDIT: About the parking apps, seems they fail in getting the location, but the timing seems correct. Very odd.
