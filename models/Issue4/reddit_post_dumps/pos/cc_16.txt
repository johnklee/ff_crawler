Pixel 2 not finding Bluetooth

Good evening,

I'm attempting to listen to music (via Spotify or Google Play Music) that is playing on my stock Pixel2 via a Bluetooth connection to my 2010 Prius v (Advanced Tech pkg)
* I've paired the phone to the Prius and am able to receive/make phone calls via the MultiFunction Display in the car.
* I verified that I have 1 of 4 phones connected to the vehicle via "Manage Phones" menu
* I am able to see the Bluetooth 'name' of the car (Snoopy) in the notification shade of my Pixel2 as a connected Device
* When I click the "AUDIO" button (to the left of the MFD), the "BT" tab is disabled from selection.
* I am unable to hear any music (spotify/google play music) via the car stereo, as I am unable to select "BT" from the audio menu.

Any ideas?
* I have unpaired / forgotten / re-paired with the Prius
* I have powered down / up the Prius and attempted to pair with the vehicle again (which yielded a successful result of PAIRING, but no "BT" tab option able to be selected.


Is it possible to Pair with the Prius so that phone calls can be made, but so that music is UNABLE to be played/BT tab is unable to be selected?
