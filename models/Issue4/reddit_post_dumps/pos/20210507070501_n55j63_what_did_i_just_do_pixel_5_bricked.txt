What did I just do? Pixel 5 Bricked?

I have a pixel 5 that is abt 6 months old, so far it's been perfect... About the only bug I encounter is the Garmin app that won't upload new activities unless I turn off/on the bluetooth. It was a hassle until I figured out that quick workaround. So today I go for a run finish the run, am listening to bluetooth headphones, turn off the bluetooth ( like may times before). This time the sound freezes in the one headphone, like the it was paused without reducing volume. The volume goes down, they disconnect, then start to reconnect. The phone is wonky though, it's not responding to touch commands, I can't press buttons etc... So I press the side button till the restart button comes up but it won't respond to touching the screen. So I long-press that side button to force a restart. I thought that's what I did but the screen showed the spinning balls and then the Google G with the oscillating progress bar underneath for about 45 minutes, then I get some sort of Andoid Recovery screen, and it says it can't load the Android system... I want to load a photo of it but my browser is telling me this subreddit doesn't allow photos?  What the fuck just happened?
