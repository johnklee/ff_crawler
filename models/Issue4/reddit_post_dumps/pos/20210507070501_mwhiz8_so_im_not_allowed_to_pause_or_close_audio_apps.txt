So I'm not allowed to pause or close audio apps when bluetooth is connected?

Seems to be universal with all audio apps but once I start listening over bluetooth I can't pause or close the app without it automatically resuming play immediately or reopening and resuming play. Disconnecting the bluetooth momentarily also does not work.

Only fix has been restarting the entire phone while on car rides.

Looking for a setting or something to just make it do what I'm telling it to do.
