Anyone still having issues with Pixel 3XL Bluetooth not working for phone calls?

Would like to hear suggestions/wondering how many others still experiencing this issue. Had this problem with Android 10 and then upgraded to 11 beta...the problem went away for like a few days oddly but has now returned...
