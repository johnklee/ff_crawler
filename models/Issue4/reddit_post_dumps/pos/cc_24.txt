My pixel 4a wifi and bluetooth function are not working

the wifi and bluebooth functions went wrong suddenly since yesterday night.
my pixel 4a cannot search any wifi network and/or bluebooth device while my other smart phones are using the same wifi network.
I have rebooted many times and finally I did the factory reset just now.
My pixel cannot search any wifi and bluebooth after the reset and I guess if the motherboard went wrong?
