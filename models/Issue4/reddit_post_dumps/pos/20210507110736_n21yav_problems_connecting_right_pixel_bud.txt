Problems Connecting right Pixel Bud

I've had pixel buds for a few months and I've had a couple problems that are usually fixed with just putting them in the case and taking them out. For some reason now I'm having. A hard time connecting the right one. When it's in the case it's not charging and before it showed it was always charging even when it was outside the case. Most of the time when I take them out and put them on I'll hear the chime that they're connected coming from both of them but when I play something it'll only play from the left ear bud. I have tried forgetting them restarting and connecting them again. And I've tried turning off Bluetooth a few times already. The left one works perfectly fine.
