Google pixel 4a 5g problem connecting with Bluetooth headphones (only right side speaker is working)

I have updated my phone, I have tried clearing the cache and storage for both phone and Bluetooth device, I have tried changing the AVRCP version and I have had no change at all, is this a software issue or a hardware issue ? 
What is going on ? 
Please Help

Thank you
