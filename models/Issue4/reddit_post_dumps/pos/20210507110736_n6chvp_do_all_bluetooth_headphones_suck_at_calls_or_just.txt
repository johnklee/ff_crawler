Do all bluetooth headphones suck at calls, or just the Pixel Buds???

I've had the 2nd gen Pixel Buds since launch - they're my first wireless headphones. I try all the time to use them on phone calls. Almost every single time, the person on the other end tells me my audio is cutting in and out. I can hear them consistently, but they apparently can't hear me well.

I love the buds other than this issue, but this is super frustrating. Should I switch to Airpods or something???? Or are all bluetooth headphones this inconsistent?
