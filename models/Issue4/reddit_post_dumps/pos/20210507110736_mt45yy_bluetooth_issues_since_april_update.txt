Bluetooth issues since April Update

Ever since the April update, I've noticed an issue regarding many audio dropouts on my Swing Galaxy Buds+ earbuds. Sometimes they'll actually disconnect entirely for a few seconds then reconnect. When this happens, the only solution is to reboot my phone. Toggling Bluetooth or putting the Buds back in their case and reconnecting doesn't help. 

Anyone else having more Bluetooth connection issues since the most recent update?
