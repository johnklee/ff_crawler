Pixel 4 bluetooth lag solution?

I've had this issue since the summer when I first got my pixel 4. I previously had a pixel 3a and never encountered this issue. I use my phone with bluetooth headphones, speaker, boom box, and in my vehicle. I mainly use them for listening to music so it's not an issue, but when trying to watch any type of video, the audio is always a couple seconds behind what the video is playing which makes it impossible for me to watch. I've done a bit of research online and haven't found a solution. Anyone possible fixes for this? Or maybe this was a contributing factor for google quickly discontinuing production of this phone.
