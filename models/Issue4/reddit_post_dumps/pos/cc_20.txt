bluetooth connection issue

Hi guys,
I have my Pixel 4a 5G for a week now and I own an Amazfit BIP Lite smart watch which I have been using forever with the "Mi Bandage" app.
I have installed the app and paired watch and restored settings+data from backup.
Everything worked for 2 days then it started dropping BT connection , on and off.
No matter what I do the phone loses BT connection with watch and keeps disconnecting and re-connecting.   I have done a factory reset on the watch, I have re-installed the APP but nothing helps.
It seems to be OK for 1-2 days then suddenly it starts the whole mess again.
Very frustrating from a brand new phone , Pixel 4a 5G.

What do you recommend ? How can this be fixed ?
