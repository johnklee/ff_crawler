Pixel buds 2 bugs

after having the pixel buds 2 for a few months I have had a few bugs. has anyone else experienced:

- uneven volume or volume only in one ear when removing and reinserting buds when playing media,

- having to forget or reset them because there refused to pair or play audio on one of the ears

- increased latency when auto unpausing after reinserting earbuds

should I be concerned for hardware problems or are they bugs?
