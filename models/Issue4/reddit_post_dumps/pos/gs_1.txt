Bluetooth is terrible

My P4a5g keeps having bluetooth problems. No matter what I connect to except the car. I have the sony wh-1000mx4 and they just keep disconnecting. Once I start listening to music or youtube they are fine. But once I pause the media it disconnects and I have to restart the bluetooth on my phone to get it to reconnect. Does anyone else having this problem or are my settings wrong somewhere.
