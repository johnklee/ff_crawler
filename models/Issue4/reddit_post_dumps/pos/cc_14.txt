Google Pixel and Android Auto Issues

I'm having such a difficult time with Android Auto on my 2019 TLX and new Pixel 4. It doesn't connect at all!

I have uninstalled and installed numerous times. Try different cables too.

Interestingly enough, my wife owns a 2019 MDX and it works fine on her car.

Took car to the dealership, they said there are no updates and we're cluelesclueles.
