Pixel 4a 'bluetooth keeps stopping' error message every few seconds

I have seen several posts on this issue from previous Pixels and on previous Android versions, but currently I have the Pixel 4a on Android 11 and since a couple of days my bluetooth has gone haywire.

 Every couple of seconds it shows me the 'Bluetooth has stopped' error message, sometimes crashing the phone completely or giving me a consecutive error message. 

So far I have tried clearing all caches and ultimately a factory reset. Surprisingly, after the factory reset, the issue was gone for about a day before it came back. What on earth is happening here? Is it software, hardware? What can I do?
