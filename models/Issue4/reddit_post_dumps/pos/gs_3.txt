Pixel 4a 5g constantly dropping bluetooth?

Both my Bose QC 35 headphones and a bluetooth speaker disconnect and reconnect when no audio is playing. I use my Bose for noise cancelling without audio for hours a day and this is driving me nuts. This did not happen on my Pixel 3a, Nexus 6P or Galaxy S7. It happens when I'm sitting perfectly still.

Is this occuring for anyone else? :(
