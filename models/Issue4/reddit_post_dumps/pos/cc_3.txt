Pixel 4a 5G bluetooth issues

I got my new 4a 5G a month ago and have been having a lot of trouble with bluetooth. Devices won't stay connected. Mainly it's fitbit and car kits and pixel buds. They all lose connection after a while. Not sure how long that actually is. Sometimes it's a few minutes other times its hours. Double annoying is that the only way to reconnect is by restarting the phone. At first I thought it seemed to be fine for the first week or two and then one day my fitbit ionic would not sync. I reset the phone and it cane back, but then it persisted, so I ended up trying to factory reset the ionic, which sadly bricked it (so my wife got me a fitbit sense for Christmas to replace the Ionic... Same problem, only now I'm cursing on Christmas at the gift she gave me ü§¶üèº*‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£). I then did a factory reset on the phone, still same issues. I contacted Google support and their answer was to exchange the phone once I told them that I had done s factory reset. I was surprised they didn't ask a single question about any permissions or other software things that could be the problem it was just "oh, you did a factory reset and that didn't fix it? ok then we'll send you a replacement" Google message boards are littered with similar comments about the 4a, 4a 5G, and 5 having bluetooth connection issues, some claim to be fixed with software updates while others don't. Anyway I figured I'd try here to see if anyone had any issues. Hopefully one of you knows more about it than Google support!
