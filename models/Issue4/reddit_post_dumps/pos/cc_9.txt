Bluetooth issues with Google Pixel (2, 2XL, 3, and 3XL)

Hello,

My wife's 2018 Disco Sport (details in my signature) has been having Bluetooth connectivity issues with both of our phones ever since we bought it, mid-2018. We both have Google Pixel phones. Last year we had the Pixel 2 and 2XL. Currently, we have the Google Pixel 3 and 3XL. Identical Bluetooth issues exist with both.

The issue:
-- Phone pairs just fine and is connected.
-- When you are on a call or streaming BT audio (and even if you're not), every 30-60 seconds the connection disconnects randomly.
-- So much so that the Bluetooth option itself (in the car's settings) becomes unchecked (phone just shows as nothing connected on BT) and then reappears after 4-8 seconds, at which point the car reconnects to the phone.
-- This happens continuously on my phone and my wife's.
-- We have tried everything, from factory resetting the car to our phones to getting any available software updates from the dealership. Nothing has helped.

I have a 2016 Tesla Model-S and both our phones work flawlessly with it over Bluetooth. My wife came to the Disco Sport from a 2015 Nissan Rogue and both our phones had worked flawlessly with that vehicle as well.

We've taken the vehicle in to our local LR/Jaguar dealership. This last time, they appeared to have done multiple software upgrades. The ironic thing is, that they gave us a Jaguar XE loaner that our phones ALSO had Bluetooth issues with (in the same exact way!). So clearly this is an issue with the Google Pixel phones and the Landrover/Jaguar infotainment system itself (and not just our vehicle specifically).

By the way, even after the software upgrades the dealership did, our phones continue to have the very same Bluetooth issues still.

Anyone else having these issues? Have you found a solution or a workaround yet?
