Pixel 4a connecting to car bluetooth, but not displaying song info

I bought a Pixel 4a 5g today. Excited about the switch from a pretty old iPhone. 

However, when I connect the phone to bluetooth in my car (2013 Volkswagen Golf), the audio plays, and I can skip songs, etc., but the song info doesn't come up on the display.  

I tried a few things that didn't solve the problem: went into developer mode and changed some bluetooth settings (recommended by an older post in this sub), unpaired then repaired, and I'm currently updating to android 11, hoping that works. 

Any other suggestions to solve this minor annoyance?
