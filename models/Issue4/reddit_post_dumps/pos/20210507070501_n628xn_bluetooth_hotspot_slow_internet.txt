Bluetooth + hotspot == slow internet

So I have noticed that often times when I use bluetooth simultaneously while creating a hotspot, the internet speed is really slow when connecting to it. I don't even have to pair bluetooth with anything, it just needs to be turned on. Anyone else encountered this?
