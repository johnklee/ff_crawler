Bluetooth issues on Android 11 Pixel 3a

Hello,

We are developing an app that uses BLE Beacons to update data from a remote device.

Using an app like NRF Connect we can see the number of BT devices around. Where as other devices see 12-14 the pixel 3a sees only 2-3.

I'm not sure I can roll back my device and definitely do not want to as permissions have changed so much in Android 11 that you HAVE to use a new device to ensure it works. 

Please Please fix the issue.
