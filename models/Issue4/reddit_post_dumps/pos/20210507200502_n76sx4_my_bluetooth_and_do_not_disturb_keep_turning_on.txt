My Bluetooth and do not disturb keep turning on by themselves.

Not sure why, but for the last week or so my phone's Bluetooth and do not disturb keep turning themselves on without any action from me. 

I thought it was a virus but I did a scan with an antivirus and even did a factory reset and the problem persists. 

Is this a known bug/issue or some new setting I don't know about?
