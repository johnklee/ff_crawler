How do I change audio output???

On my old LG, I could swipe down from the top, and there was an audio output setting so even if I was connected via bluetooth, I could toggle to the phone speakers for a bit. I can't find this option on my pixel 5. 

The only workarounds I've found are: 

1) turn bluetooth off completely

2) open a music player, start a song playing over bluetooth, pause the song, then swipe down to the music player control, and switch the audio output there. 

This seems like such an obvious thing to need, and it's so frustrating to not have it available!
