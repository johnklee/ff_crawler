May 21 security patch and YouTube music/Bluetooth crashes

Hey Pixel users. Just checking if anyone else started experiencing this with the May patch. 

My regular 4A started having Bluetooth connection issues that might be related to the YouTube music app crashing. 

I can't get the app to launch until a reboot. It's happened about 4 times over the past 48 hours or so. 

Thanks for reading.
