Pixel 4 and Model 3 Bluetooth Issues

I got a new phone around the same time I got a software update, so not sure which introduced the issue. For some reason my (new) Pixel 4 XL no longer auto-connects to the car bluetooth. This was never an issue with my Galazy S9 so I assume it's the phone. Since then every morning, BT is not connected, and what's strange is that trying to connect via the phone doesn't work. I need to go into the car's BT settings, select the device and click connect. Works almost instantly, every time.

I guess it's unlikely I'll get anyone with a similar issue since the phone is so new, but just in case... thanks!
