Pixel 4a (5G) Paired w/ Pixel Buds (2nd Gen) -- Terrible Performance

I recently bought both of these devices and I'm not very impressed with using the Pixel Buds with this phone. I am consistently getting one ear cutting off, lots of "interference" sounds, and sputtering/garbage sound (I guess this is the best I can explain). Basically, it's like I'm getting out of bluetooth range, but it's right here in my pocket or on the table next to me. 

I do use the Pixel Buds with my MacBook Pro and it is flawless. I can walk all over my house and no issues. 

I am thinking it's more on the phone end rather than the ear buds. Anyone else having this problem??
