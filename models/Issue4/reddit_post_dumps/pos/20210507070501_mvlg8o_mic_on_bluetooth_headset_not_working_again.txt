Mic on bluetooth headset not working again!

Again, the phone will not take any audio input from my blue parrot headset. Worked fine up until yesterday and now, nothing. ðŸ¤¬ I am so fed up with this POS phone, last POS I'll ever buy from google. Besides the fact that the phone randomly corrupted itself forcing an unwelcome hard reset, loosing ally pictures, now I can't even used the BT function. How has this NOT been addressed yet!? I don't want to hard reset the phone every effing time the BT decides not to work!
